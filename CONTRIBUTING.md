# Node.js Community Contributing Guide 1.0

## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct explains the *bare minimum* behavior
expectations the Node.js Foundation requires from all contributors.
[Please read it before participating.](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request.
* A **Collaborator** is a contributor who has been given write access to the repository
* An **Observer** is any individual who has requested or been requested to attend a CommComm meeting. It is also the first step to becoming a Member.
* A **Member** is a collaborator with voting rights who has met the requirements of participation to be considered for acceptance, and subsequently voted in by the CommComm voting process.

## Start Here:

- Take a look at any issues tagged with [Good First Issue](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

## Teams and Working Groups
The Community Committee represents a collection of teams and working groups that are expressly working toward growing and supporting the overall Node.js community. Node.js as a whole needs a broad range of skills and contributions, which are not necessarily technical in nature, to thrive.

You can see the current teams and working groups in the ["Teams and Working Groups"](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee#current-teams-and-working-groups) section of the README.md file - if there is one that seems to cover an area of particular interest to you, you should take a look at the Team or Working Group's repo to see how you can get further involved.

# Logging Issues

Log an issue for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue,
any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses. The only
exception is security disclosures which should be sent privately. If you have a concern that is Code
of Conduct related and do not feel comfortable reporting publicly, please reach out to an individual listed under Community Committee Collaborators

Collaborators may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications, and
add appropriate metadata before the issue is addressed.

Please be courteous, respectful, and every participant is expected to follow the
project's Code of Conduct.

# Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes
to documentation, code, binary files, etc. Even long term collaborators and WG members must use
pull requests.

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that
contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to
weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active collaborators all have reasonable time to
become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no collaborator has an objection.
During review collaborators may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a
particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off"
process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by collaborators are addressed it can
be landed by any collaborator.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another collaborator, all involved
collaborators should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed
by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

If a contribution is controversial and collaborators cannot agree about how to get it to land
or if it should land then it should be escalated to the WG. WG members should regularly
discuss pending contributions in order to find a resolution. It is expected that only a
small minority of issues be brought to the WG for resolution and that discussion and
compromise among collaborators be the default resolution mechanism.

# Becoming a Member and Collaborator

To become a member of the Community Committee, start participating! Attend the bi-weekly meetings, investigate issues tagged as `good first issue`,
file issues and pull requests, and provide insight via GitHub. Request to become an Observer by
filing an issue. Once added as an Observer to meetings, we will track attendance and participation
for 3 months, as according to our [governance guidelines](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#section-4-establishment-of-the-community-committee). If you meet the minimum
attendance and are participating, the CommComm will vote to add you as a member.

All participants added as members should be on-boarded in a timely manner, added as a collaborator, and be given write access to the repository.

Collaborators are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go through
proper review, and have other collaborators merge their pull requests.

# The CommComm Process

The CommComm uses a "consensus seeking" process for issues that are escalated to the CommComm.
The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among the CommComm members.
If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote
is called. It is also expected that the majority of decisions made by the CommComm are via
a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.

Resolution may involve returning the issue to collaborators with suggestions on how to
move forward towards a consensus. It is not expected that a meeting of the CommComm
will resolve all issues on its agenda during that meeting and may prefer to continue
the discussion happening among the collaborators.

Members can be added to the CommComm at any time. Any collaborator can nominate another collaborator
to the CommComm and the CommComm uses its standard consensus seeking process to evaluate whether or
not to add this new member. Members who do not participate consistently at the level of
a majority of the other members are expected to resign.

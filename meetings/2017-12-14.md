### User Feedback update

* Had first meeting
* Regular interval set for every 2 weeks
* Next meeting Greg from Linux foundation will give us some additional insight on the yearly
  Node.js survey, discussed having people opt in as part of the survey as being interested in
  being contacted for additional questions etc.
* Issue asking for business involvement - https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues/20.
  Adam volunteered to make an email template people can use to forward to companies they
  think would be good to invite and add to issue.

### Mentorship Team under the CommComm [172](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/172)
* Goal is help more people join the community
* Working in https://github.com/Bamieh/node-ment 
* Will be sending pairs that they match an email
* Have meeting with pair to do introductions, setup communication channel and how to go
   Forward
* Matching should come from the repos (ex core should nominate mentors/mentees for 
   that repo)
* Pairing done by commcomm participants.
* Factor in language preferences
* Add info to repo README as well as have slack to communicate
* Restrict mentorship to a given timeline, suggested 6 months is a good timeline which
  gives around 10-12 meetings.

* TODO: Tierney volunteered to open issue in Admin to propose moving repo into the nodejs org
* TODO: issue in TSC for awareness - https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/443

### Node.js Strategic Initiatives beyond technical matters [186](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/186)
* Discussion on. LinkedIn discussion, reasonably large membership base, currently owned by member of the
  Foundation. https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/tree/master/documents/local_initiatives
https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/185. Discussion about getting foundation/community committee
* In agreement that we should do it (no objections).

### Node.js People Everywhere [184](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/184)
* Diego gave us a quick overview
  * suggestion for platform/website to help companies and people get together
  * this will help build community by making companies more comfortable that they can get resources
     they need if they chose Node.js and developers find companies if they want to work with Node.js
  * would be good as pages on main website or at least very closely linked
  * some good examples of other places doing something along these lines:
    * https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs
    * http://www.scala-lang.org/community/
* Tierney - example were we had allowed submissions of local events:
   https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/tree/master/documents/local_initiatives

* Next steps 
  * TODO: Diego: figure out what MVP looks like in the issue 
  * TODO: Tierney: find additional contributors
  * TODO: Tierney: find champion in community committee and then add to initiatives list

# Initiative Reporting

### nodejs/admin

- Tracking issue for update on CPC and Board Meetings [#395](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/395)
  - Joe gave feedback on this, please take a look at Travel Fund nodejs/admin issue #398.

### nodejs/community-committee

- Towards less conflicts from biases/assumptions in communication styles/conventions [#507](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/507)

  - Saleh raised accessibility issues. Points out that it isn’t just font issues and conventional accessibility issues, for example certain aspects of communication. Thoughtful explanation in issue description.
  - Saleh: not immediate change that we can make, but rather develop an initiative around improving communications that are more accessible — my personal experience being just one of potentially more related or different attempts to gradually transition into an equally productive collaborator in different project venues — the initiative here would consider how to capture, learn from, recommend, and finally improve the odds of this happening.
  - Tierney: (propose initiative in an issue)
  - Saleh: calling for those interested in co-authoring and/or helping out (please reply in https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/507).

- Removing labels in archived repos [#505](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/505)
- Tierney: can close this issue. He worked with Michael Dawson to clear out labels (particularly good first issue labels in archived repos)

- Charter Update to Reflect New OpenJS Foundation [#499](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/499)

  - No update.

- Node.js Social Media Community Collaboration [#444](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/444)
- Rachel: 2 areas for feedback
  - Google form now doesn’t work; created new form and sent out; will add to github as well
  - Where should this program live?
- Tierney: Should be an initiative? (no objection from the group in attendance)
- Tierney: Raised his hand to champion.

- Node.js Collection – Next Steps [#439](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/439)

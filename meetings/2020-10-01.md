Discussion on Comm Comm activity/inactivity:

Questions
- Should CommComm continue to exist?
  - Motivation was stronger voice for community growth, support for non-technical work

- What benefit is CommComm providing?
- What is its overarching purpose?
- Are we currently serving that purpose and providing that benefit?
- If not, what can/should we be doing better?
- And howâ€¦
- Is the current level of activity a problem?

Tierney: CommComm could do more governance work in Admin; is there an adaption to how we work

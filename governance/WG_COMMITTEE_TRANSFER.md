# Transferring a Working Group from One Node.js Committee to Another
As interested, a Node.js Working Group may decide that it would like to move from one Node.js Committee to another to ensure that it is under the Committee that will be most representative of its goals.

This document is a guide on how to begin the transfer process from one committee to another.

## The Committee Transferring Checklist
Here's a checklist for you to get started with transferring committees. This list is meant to help a Working Group make sure everything that _needs_ to be complete to effectively transfer committees actually _is_ complete.

- [] Ensure the Working Group is in alignment on moving from the current committee to the new committee
- [] Have the current committee vote to decharter
- [] Have the new committee vote (and approve) a new charter
- [] Mark that the Working Group has been dechartered in the Working Groups documentation for the current committee
- [] Submit a PR to the new committee adding the Working Group to the Working Groups documentation for the new committee

## In depth: A guide to moving from one Committee
While the process of moving from one top-level committee to another is likely going to be one of the smoother parts of this process, we've documented it in case you want some help with going through the process of this transition.

### Moving from one Committee to another Committee

* **Step 1**: Create an issue in the repository for the Working Group in question and gain approval from the Working Group for the move.
  * **Step 1.1**: If there _are no objections_, continue to Step 2.
* **Step 2**: Create an issue in the repository of the new Committee asking if it would be willing to take the Working Group in question on as a Working Group of that Committee.
  * **Step 2.1**: If there _are no objections_, continue to Step 2.2.
  * **Step 2.2**: If there _are objections_ by the committee, continue to Step 3.
* **Step 3**: Once approved by both the WG and the new Committee, you will need to create two pull requests: one pull request to be dechartered by the previous Committee and one pull request to be chartered by the new Committee.
* **Step 4**: Once dechartered by the previous Committee and chartered by the new Committee, you can use the following checklist
  * [] Have the current committee vote to decharter
  * [] Have the new committee vote a new charter
  * [] Mark that the Working Group has been dechartered in the Working Groups documentation for the current committee
  * [] Submit a PR to the new committee adding the Working Group to the Working Groups documentation for the new committee

This document contains information for Collaborators of the Node.js
Community Committee regarding maintaining the code, documentation, and issues.

Collaborators should be familiar with the guidelines for new
contributors in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and also
understand the project governance model as outlined in
[GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/tree/main/governance).

## Issues and Pull Requests

Courtesy should always be shown to individuals submitting issues and
pull requests to the Node.js Community Committee.

Collaborators should feel free to take full responsibility for
managing issues and pull requests they feel qualified to handle, as
long as this is done while being mindful of these guidelines, the
opinions of other Collaborators and guidance of the Community Committee Members.

Collaborators may **close** any issue or pull request they believe is
not relevant for the future of the Node.js project. Where this is
unclear, the issue should be left open for several days to allow for
additional discussion. Where this does not yield input from Node.js
Collaborators or additional evidence that the issue has relevance, the
issue may be closed. Remember that issues can always be re-opened if
necessary.

## Accepting Modifications

All modifications should be performed via GitHub pull requests.

All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a Collaborator with
sufficient expertise who is able to take full responsibility for the
change. In the case of pull requests proposed by an existing
Collaborator, an additional Collaborator, is required for sign-off.

In some cases, it may be necessary to summon a qualified Collaborator
to a pull request for review by @-mention.

If you are unsure about the modification and are not prepared to take
full responsibility for the change, defer to another Collaborator.

Before landing pull requests, sufficient time should be left for input
from other Collaborators. Leave at least 48 hours during the week and
72 hours over weekends to account for international time differences
and work schedules. Trivial changes (e.g., typos or content changes)
maybe landed after a shorter delay.

Where there is no disagreement amongst Collaborators, a pull request
may be landed given appropriate review. Where there is discussion
amongst Collaborators, consensus should be sought if possible. The
lack of consensus may indicate the need to elevate discussion to the
Community Committee Members for resolution (see below).

### Involving the Community Committee Members

Collaborators may opt to elevate pull requests or issues to the Community
Committee Members for discussion by mentioning `@nodejs/community-committee`.
This should be done where a pull request:

- has a significant impact on the content,
- is inherently controversial; or
- has failed to reach consensus amongst the Collaborators who are
  actively participating in the discussion.

The CC Members should serve as the final arbiter where required.

### Cross-coordination Guidelines to Other Governing Groups
All Board requests should be communicated to the Individual Member Directors from the
CommComm Chairperson each month as resolutions or updates. Directors present
at the Board session are responsible for championing these items.

The CommComm Chairperson should also coordinate with the TSC Director and Chairperson
to ensure all relevant CommComm items have been familiarized ahead of the Board meeting.
The Chairperson of the CommComm is responsible for communicating to the TSC chair any
cross-concerning discussions, attending meetings to coordinate efforts, and see how we
need get input from each group.

The Individual Member Directors need to email agenda items to the Node.js Executive Director
the Thursday prior to each Board meeting. The Board meeting occurs the last Tuesday of every
month. In-between meetings, Individual Membership Directors, can email important updates to
the Board to familiarize topics prior to Board meeting.

Be mindful about timeframes on needing approval across governing groups and the Board.
Some initiatives may take weeks, not days, for everything to align.

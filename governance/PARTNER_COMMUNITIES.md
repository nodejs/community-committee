Node.js has largely been successful because of the grassroots communities that have sprouted up around it. There are dozens of communities both centrally located around the world and accessible online.

The Node.js Community Committee has begun working on partnering with these grassroots communities, to give Node.js and JavaScript developers a path to connecting with other developers with similar interests. Communities that are interested in partnering can follow the guidelines set out within this document and then submit a Pull Request to the document to be added.

Any questions regarding joining or participating in a partner community should be directed to a Node.js Collaborator liaison.

## Partner Communities
* [Node Slackers](http://www.nodeslackers.com/)
  * Node.js Collaborator Liaisons: [@dshaw](https://github.com/dshaw) and [@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb)

## Requirements for Becoming a Partner Community:
* Have a published Code of Conduct in similar spirit to the [Node.js project](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and are knowledgable in executing on reports by participants and community members.
* Have a Moderation Policy and enforce it.
* Have a Node.js Collaborator who is willing to act as a liason and is an administrator.
* Acknowledgement that the members of CommComm can remove the Partner Community at any time if a report is made in potential violation of the requirements. This interpretation is up to the consideration and discretion of Node.js CommComm to decide.

## Disclaimer
Node.js Partner Communities empower awesome groups in our global ecosystem by amplifying their voices, providing guidance, and building a knowledge-base of how to build a community. Partner communities as recognized are not official, legal representatives of the Node.js Foundation or project.

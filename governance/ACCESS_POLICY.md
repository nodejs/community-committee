# Account Access Policy

## Zoom

Send email to operations@openjsf.org to get credentials for Zoom account.

## YouTube

The chairpersons of the TSC and Community Committee can grant access to project members so they can start YouTube streams for the meetings.

## LinkedIn Node.js Group

Any Community Committee member can become a group admin. Ask an existing admin for access. Existing admins should only add current [Community Committee members](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee#community-committee-members) to the list.

## General Rules That Apply to All Account Access

- The [Membership Expectations](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MemberExpectations.md) – specifically as they apply to project leadership – fully applies to this.
- Adding anyone who should not be added will be reviewed by the CommComm and could be grounds for immediate removal of access/CommComm membership.

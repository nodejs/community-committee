I, \___ [below signatory] \___, a member of the Node.js Community Committee, a committee chartered by the
Node.js Foundation Board of Directors, hereby certify that I have read and understand, to the best of
my ability, the [Community Committee Charter][], [Moderation Policy][], and the [Node.js Code of Conduct][].
I understand this is a leadership role and that my actions and conduct may influence the perceived beliefs
and image of our community. I vow to conduct myself, in all public venues, in a capacity that appropriately
represents the Node.js Community's values, as determined by this committee, for the duration of my tenure.

This commitment _is not a requirement_ for participation in this committee. I offer this in good-faith and I will honor it.

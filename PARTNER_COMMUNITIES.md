Node.js has largely been successful because of the grassroots communities that have sprouted up around it. There are dozens of communities both centrally located around the world and accessible online.

The Node.js Community Committee has begun working on partnering with these grassroots communities, to give Node.js and JavaScript developers a path to connecting with other developers with similar interests. Communities that are interested in partnering can follow the guidelines set out within this document and then submit a Pull Request to the document to be added.

## Partner Communities
* [Node Slackers](http://www.nodeslackers.com/)
  * Node.js Collaborator Liasons: [@dshaw](https://github.com/dshaw) and [@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb)

## Requirements for Becoming a Partner Community:
* Have a Code of Conduct.
* Have a Moderation Policy.
* Have a Node.js Collaborator who is willing to act as a liason and is an administrator.

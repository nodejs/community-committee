## Contributors

An individual begins contributing as a "Contributor". A contributor is any individual
participating in working groups or initiatives of the Community Committee by:

* commenting on an issue or pull request, OR
* creating an issue or pull request

Contributors have no special access to the repositories under the Community Committee.

### Becoming a Contributor

To begin contributing to working groups and initiatives, start participating!

Attend the meetings of the working group or initiative, investigate issues tagged
as `good first issue`, open issues and pull requests, or provide insight via GitHub.

Individuals can open an issue asking to be an invited Guest to CommComm meetings. You
can find a great example of such an issue [here](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/142)!

## Collaborators

CommComm Collaborators are active contributors with write access to the repo(s)
relevant to their initiative or working group.

Active Contributors in the CommComm repositories can be nominated by another
Collaborator to become a Collaborator. On approval by existing Collaborators
through the consensus process, the nominated Contributor becomes a Collaborator.

### Collaborator Activities

Typical activities of a Collaborator include:

* Helping users and novice contributors
* Contributing code, non-code, and documentation changes that improve the project
* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* Participating in working groups or initiatives
* Merging pull requests

The CommComm periodically reviews the Collaborator list to identify inactive Collaborators.
Past Collaborators are typically given Emeritus status. Emeriti may request that
the CommComm restore them to active status.

## Members

Active Collaborators of a CC initiative or working group
can self-nominate or be nominated by a CommComm Member to
become a Member of CommComm. On approval by the consensus
process, the Collaborator becomes a Member.

Collaborators voted in as Members are given write access to all repositories of
the Community Committee, the admin repos, and the moderation repo.

CC Members are administrative and help to remove barriers for initiatives and working
groups under CC’s scope. CC Members are involved primarily with decisions that have
wider reaching effects than within a single initiative or individual working group.
CC Members are responsible for making decisions when consensus cannot be reached
among Collaborators.

Working groups and initiatives should check-in with CC. As the CC Members serve
as a point of reference for initiatives and working groups, this check-in helps
to keep all stakeholders across the Node.js project up-to-date. This improves the
initiatives' and working groups' accountability and success.

### CC Meetings

The CC meets regularly in a voice conference call. The meeting is run by a
designated meeting chair approved by the C. Each meeting is streamed on
YouTube.

Items are added to the CC agenda which are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, CC membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches.
That should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be reviewed
by the CC by logging a GitHub issue. Any Collaborator, CC member, or the
meeting chair can bring the issue to the CC's attention by applying the
`cc-review` label. If consensus-seeking among CC members fails for a
particular issue, it may be added to the CC meeting agenda by adding the
`cc-agenda` label.

Prior to each CC meeting, the meeting chair will share the agenda with
members of the CC. CC members can also add items to the agenda at the
beginning of each meeting. The meeting chair and the CC cannot veto or remove
items.

The CC may invite additional persons to participate in a non-voting capacity.

The meeting chair is responsible for ensuring that minutes are taken and that a
pull request with the minutes is submitted after the meeting.

Due to the challenges of scheduling a global meeting with participants in
several timezones, the CC will seek to resolve as many agenda items as possible
outside of meetings using
[the Community-Committee issue tracker](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues). The process in
the issue tracker is:

* A CC member opens an issue explaining the proposal/issue and @-mentions
  @nodejs/community-committee.
* After 72 hours, if there are two or more `LGTM`s from other CC members and no
  explicit opposition from other CC members, then the proposal is approved.
* If there are any CC members objecting, then a conversation ensues until
  either the proposal is dropped or the objecting members are persuaded. If
  there is an extended impasse, a motion for a vote may be made.

## Collaborator Nominations

Active Contributors of a CC initiative or working group can be
nominated by another Collaborator to become a Collaborator of
that initiative or working group. Contributors making
significant, ongoing, and valuable contributions are also
identified by the CC and their addition as Collaborators is
discussed during the weekly CC meeting. On approval by the
consensus process, the Contributor becomes a Collaborator and is
given commit-access to the repo(s) relevant to their initiative.

Modifications to the contents of the git repositor(y/ies) under
the responsibility of the Collaborators are made on a
collaborative basis as defined in the development process.
Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus,
to the CC for discussion by assigning the cc-agenda tag to a
pull request or issue. The CC should serve as the final arbiter
where required. The CC will maintain and publish a list of
current Collaborators by Project, as well as a development
process guide for Collaborators and Contributors looking to
participate in the effort.

Collaborators may request Emeritus status when they find themselves inactive. The
CC also periodically reviews the Collaborator list to identify inactive Collaborators.
Past Collaborators are typically given Emeritus status. Emeriti may request that
the CC restore them to active status.

### Onboarding

All collaborators added as CommComm members should be on-boarded in a timely manner
and be given write access to the repository.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The CC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model as described by
the [CC Charter][].

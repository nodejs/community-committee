## Purpose

To establish and administer a fund for members of the Node.js
Foundation Community Committee(CommComm) to travel and spread knowledge about and support the foundation
and the Node.js Foundation projects.

## Restrictions

* Candidates must be CommComm Members of the Node.js project.

## Process

Any member can apply for travel funds. Each request may take up to a month
for the CommComm to approve or decline.

* Open a pull request against this repository which adds an entry to the table at the bottom of this file.
 * Include the name of the event you plan to attend.
 * Include the location of the event and where you will be traveling from.
 * Include the presentation you intend to give, if applicable.
 * Include the size of the stipend you wish to receive.
  * Reimbursement stipends are expected to vary with travel distance.
* Once the final amount spent is known, update the table again with that information.

The CommComm will consider each proposal in its next regular meeting. While it is
ultimately at the CommComm's discretion who to approve the following considerations
are made.

* Impact: Preference given to underserved communities. More specifically,
within a subject the foundation is trying to promote awareness about (e.g.
general knowledge about the foundation) there are people, communities and
geographies where that knowledge is not very widespread. This is where
preference will be given. For instance, an event in San Francisco would be
less attractive than an event of the same size in Kansas City.
* Cost: The larger the stipend the more critically the CommComm will consider the application.
Budget for this program is a finite resource.
* Equity: Preference given to individuals who do not have a corporate travel fund and have
not previously received a stipend.

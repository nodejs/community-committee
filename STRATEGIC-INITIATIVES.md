# Strategic Initiatives

At any one time the Node.js project has a number of strategic initiatives
underway.  With the less-tangible approach to the work that the Community 
Committee does, having a way to track this work is important.

For each strategic initiative, the Community Committee's goal is to have a
single point of reference - a champion - that understands what's happening
with the initiative to the fullest extent posssible, and can report on the
initiative as needed.

A review of the initiatives will be a standing item on the Community Committee agenda (even
if the update is 'nothing new') as a way to ensure they are active
and have the support needed.

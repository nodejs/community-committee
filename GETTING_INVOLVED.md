## Teams and Working Groups
The Community Committee is a Committee that represents a collection of teams and working groups that are expressly working toward growing the Node.js Community in via contributions that are not necessarily technical in nature, but rather focus on the community that uses Node.js.

You can see the current teams and working groups in the ["Teams and Working Groups"]() section of the README.md file - if there is one that seems to cover an area of particular interest to you, you should take a look at the Team or Working Group's repo to see how you can get further involved.
